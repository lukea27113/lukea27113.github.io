    <h3>Among Us</h3>
    Among Us was coded into scratch by scratcher <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/TimMcCool">@TimMcCool.</a> How it works (in a nutshell): At the beginning of the game, the project chooses impostors. Those players @me variable is set to Impostor . Currently, there is a button on the remix on the top right corner that changes the @me variable to Impostor . Also hitboxes have been removed.
